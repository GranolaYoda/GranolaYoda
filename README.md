- 👋 Hi, I’m @GranolaYoda
- 👀 I’m interested in AI machine learning and language intent processing to identify when misunderstanding occurs and/or purposeful deflection in coded langauge. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python at Georgia tech, and Google's Jigsaw perspective API
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate developer and moderator tools from jigsaw as described on their page. I want to learn how to edit, and add new classification to the existing open code to identify not just toxicity, but the nueances of sarcasm and coded language the goes undected. Seeking to create an video analysis AI tool for live news to screen and indentify language intent. Also, work on detection of coded bias that misunderstood or improperly indentified language intent as toxic to relationship levels that exist within language groups. I'm seeking collaberation with Boston University's Anti-racist Research Center to analyze their research database of descriminitory policies and upload data sets to tag correlations in language intent.
